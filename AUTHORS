ESL-Bundle is the result of various long-running collaborations involving
many researchers, research groups and engineers in the fields of electronic
structure, quantum chemistry, and computer science. The following author
list is known to be incomplete. Feel free to extend it, so that it better
reflects reality. ESL-Bundle is made of a collection of libraries and a building
framework to compile and install those libraries.


The building framework is based on a modified version of JHBuild. JHBuild was
written by James Henstridge. It is part of the GNOME Project and is distributed
under the GNU General Public License version 2. The the original source code can
be found at:
