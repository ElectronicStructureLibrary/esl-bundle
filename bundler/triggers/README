This directory contains GNOME post-installation trigger scripts (in
theory these could go with the modules, but there aren't many of them,
so eh).

A .trigger file is a set of regular expressions (or literal matches)
which are evaluated against files installed after any "make install
DESTDIR=", combined with a shell script to run if any of them match.
In the future, these may also be matched against deleted files.

The contents of a .trigger file are just /bin/sh shell script, with a
few magic comments.  During the run of a .trigger file, the
environment variable JHBUILD_PREFIX is guaranteed to be set.

Currently recognized comments:

# IfExecutable: STRING
  Only run if the given executable is available in $PATH
# LiteralMatch: STRING
  Match against installed/removed manifest if the given STRING is a substring of a file or directory.
# REMatch: REGEXP
  Match against installed/removed manifest using the given REGEXP in Python syntax.
