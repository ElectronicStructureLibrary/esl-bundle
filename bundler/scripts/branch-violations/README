These are a bunch of scripts that can be used to find modules
in a module set that lack the proper revision tag.  To use, run:

	./find-branch-violations X.Y

where X.Y is the major.minor version of the GNOME release you want to check.
What it does is:

	* It fetches the jhbuild moduleset for that version of GNOME from
	CVS HEAD, using viewcvs.  Note that it does not use your checked-out
	version.

	* It fetches a list of all modules in GNOME CVS that have a branch
	named gnome-X-Y.  It's actually more than just top-level CVS modules.
	They way it works is, it gets a list of all files named ChangeLog,
	with a branch tag of gnome-X-Y, using Bonsai.

	* It outputs those modules from the first list above, that don't have
	a revision gnome-X-Y tag, but are listed in the second list above.


That's basically it.  Bonsai takes a while to run the query, so take your
time...  You need wget and xmllint to be in PATH for these to work.

Known problems:

	Bonsai is known to be broken and not report certain directories, or
	lag behind too long...
