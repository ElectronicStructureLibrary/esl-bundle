GNOME Bugzilla #52890: improved time zone handling

This patch adds a new utility function e_cal_check_timezones() to
libecal. The library version of libecal is bumped in a backwards
compatible way: code compiled against previous releases still works
with the extended library.

e_cal_check_timezones() can be used by calendar backends to fix two
problems:

1. Importing a new meeting invitation into a calendar which already
contains an old time zone definition ignores the new time zone
definition. The new meeting is then displayed using the old
definition.

2. There is no mechanism to update the time zone rules used by
existing meetings if their time zone changes.

If possible, time zone definitions are mapped to the system time zone
definitions used by Evolution. Currently this only works for time zone
definitions which have a known location at the end of their time zone
identifiers (i.e., older Evolution releases and other programs
following the Olson database naming scheme). If this mapping works,
then problem 1 and 2 no longer occur (but see the caveat below).

If the mapping fails, then problem 1 is avoided by checking for an
existing, conflicting time zone definition first and importing items
with a renamed time zone definition in such a case.

The caveat with regards to time zone handling is that Evolution only
uses a subset of the information available for a system time
zone. Events using a system time zone are only guaranteed to be
displayed correctly starting at the current time and one year into the
future. Past events and events even further into the future may be
displayed incorrectly. 

Due to this limitation, past meetings which would have been displayed
correctly using the time zone information they came with might be
displayed incorrectly using Evolution's stripped system time zones.
This limitation needs to be addressed separately in further patches.

e-cal-check-timezones.[ch] are 1:1 copies of
SyncEvolution/trunk revision 625.
