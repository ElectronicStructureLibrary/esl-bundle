1. [x] Rebase bundler on JHBuild master. (DC)
1. [x] Separate changes common to all from those specific to BigDFT.
1. [x] Have a config file for defaults instead of hard-coding.
1. [x] defaults.jhbuildrc: read variables from modulesets?
1. [x] Check that the moduleset is readily parsed after defaults.jhbuildrc.


Developer documentation:

- The master branch is upstream JHBuild.
- Our branch is bundler.
- Tell people to do a git reset --hard origin/bundler.
- C_INCLUDE_PATH: JHBuild default for previously installed packages,we export
  it in configure flags to be able to run make outside JHBuild.
- LDFLAGS idem.
- Explain how to synchronize ESL with BigDFT.

User documentation:

- Review existing documents.
- Plan tutorials for selected targets.
- Document dist, check, + clean for distutils.

Note: FCFLAGS not supported by JHBuild, must do it manually.
